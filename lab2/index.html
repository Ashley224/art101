      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>This is all about Yuhao & Ashley...</p>

<p>	I’m Ashley, I am a first-year at UCSC. I’m a proposed Art major and I am from Los Angeles, CA.
	I really enjoy photography and painting in my free time. Some interesting facts about me are that
	I have a pet turtle named Tortugo (turtle in Spanish), I enjoy fishing, dirt biking, and going on road trips.	</p>
	
<p>I’m Yuhao, I am currently a sophomore majoring in AGPM. I enjoy reading and playing games. And I
	also work on several games in my spare time. I like to go on adventures and meet different people. </p>
