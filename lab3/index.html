		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p> For Lab3 we modified our file structure so it met requirements,
				 and we made add an site index on our main index.html. We uploaded
				 a picture of ourselves to our own git repository and we linked the
				 picture to index.html as well. And below are some challenges we met
				 during this process and a screenshot of the file structure mentioned
				 above. </p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> We have encountered many difficulties at the beginning of our lab.
			 We had tried to connect our GitHub and/or atoms but unfortunately,
			  it wouldnâ€™t allow us due to some technical difficulties with both
				of our laptops running into complications. Either internet connection
				or laptops having troubleshoots. However, we got the hang of it and
				tried to follow the steps more efficiently on Lab 3 on canvas. In the
				end, we found our way around with GitHub and were able to work on the
				lab more effectively. </p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p> Here is a screenshot of our file structure:</p>
