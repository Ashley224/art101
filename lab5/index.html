				<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
				<p>We are working together and experiementing with basic
					JavaScript date types and variables. :)</p>
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>We gladly didnâ€™t face many challenges for this lab.
					It was quite simple thanks to the previous experiments
					we did during the lecture. As well as, looking back at
					some lecture notes along with screenshots really helped
					us to understand this lab more effectively.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>We successfully did the index.html file and here is a
					 screenshot of the completion.</p>
