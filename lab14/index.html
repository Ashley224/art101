		<p>Working with Yuhao and debugging past labs.</p>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>We didn't encounter anything that's particular challenging.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I did have problems within Lab 11 & Lab 12 due to spelling erros and technical
			difficulties. My js files and Css files hadn't been functioning properly
			and was fixed by using
			console log.</p>
		<h3>Results!</h3>
		<p>Look back at these fixed labs :)</p>
