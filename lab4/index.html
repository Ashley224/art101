    <h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      One challenge we encountered was brainstorming ideas for the task we were
      going to revolve the lab around. We were trying to figure out if we would
      prefer a game or an everyday task approach. Another challenge we faced,
      was trying to write each baby step into a more detailed and specific
      comment.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Thankfully we didn’t face many problems in this lab, so the only problem
      we faced, was trying to discover how to input the comments into the
      index.html.
    </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>In the end, we successfully made produced a pseudo code:</p>
    <pre>
			<code>
				// Loop until we find all the trash
				//    Search the desk for trash
				//    Pick up the trash and put it in the trash bin
				// Loop until everything is off the desk
				//    Pick up one item from the desk
				//    Move the item to another place
				// Wipe the desk clean
				// Loop until everything is organized on the desk
				//    Pick up an item from the other place
				//    Place the item on the desk
				// Loop until we find every item we need for later
				//    Look for an item we are going to use later
				//    Organize the item on the desk
			</code>
		</pre>
    <h2>Summary/Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This Lab had been fun to experiment with, It was interesting to see how
      simple baby steps when listing a task has much more details within it.
      Since we are so used to doing these basic tasks, it’s never been taken
      into consideration every step you have to do in order to do the everyday
      task. We’ve learned how to input the comments into the HTML in order not
      for it to collapse which seemed more simple than previous labs. It had
      been difficult in the beginning to try to come up with ideas/tasks to use
      in the lab, but thankfully in the end we had successfully made a pseudo
      code.
