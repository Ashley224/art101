				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>One of the first challenges we faced was trying to actually figure
					out on how to start on the lab. Trying to see how everything would
					actually function properly without getting an error message.</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Some problems we did face was seeing the instructions since It
					seemed the screenshot was misplaced. As well as, try to see how the
					JavaScript would flow on the browser without getting an error message.
				</p>
				<h3>Results</h3>
				<p>We successfully did the index.html file and here is a screenshot
					of the completion.
